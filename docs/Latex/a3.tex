\section{BORG Calendar}

\begin{itemize}
\item The data flow analysis you performed and the calculation of the coverage metrics. You must
show which test cases are responsible for which dc-paths.
\item A description of the test cases you added to improve coverage. If your coverage was already high,
discuss how your testing was able to achieve this.
\item The slices that you identified and the percentage of slices that your testing covers. You must
show which test cases are responsible for which slices.
\item A description of the test cases you added to improve slice coverage. If your coverage was
already high, discuss how your testing was able to achieve this.
\item Evaluate the effectiveness of your test cases using mutation testing. Discuss and address any
issues if you have found in your written report.
\item Attaching bug reports if bugs are discovered using your testing methods. You should use the
same bug report format as in Assignment 1. Do not file these bug reports to the projectâ€™s bug
report system.
\item An appendix with the specification of the methods you are testing
\end{itemize}

\section{JPetStore}

\begin{itemize}
\item The test scenarios that you have created;
\item The request rates and the duration of the load tests;
\item The analysis of your load tests and the description of any problems that you have found (if there
are any).
\end{itemize}
